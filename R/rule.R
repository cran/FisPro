#' @field premises [integer] vector, The premises of the rule\cr
#' A premise is the 1-based index of MF in the [FisIn]\cr
#' 0 means the input is not taken into account for this rule, i.e. the rule is incomplete\cr
#' The vector length must be equal to the number of inputs in the [Fis]
#' @field conclusions [numeric] vector, The conclusions of the rule\cr
#' A conclusion is a [numeric] value for crisp output [FisOutCrisp], or the 1-based index of MF in the fuzzy output [FisOutFuzzy]\cr
#' The vector length must be equal to the number of outputs in the [Fis]
